    "Luke" "No, it's her nap time now, thank God."
    "UnknownMan" "I thougt you enjoy to play with that little princess."
    "Luke" "Are you kidding me, if it were not for our parents' request, how could I talk to that freak?"
    "UnknowMan" "But I think you always talk and laugh when you are with her."
    "Luke" "Please, I'm tired of making me smirk at her every day, don't make fun of me anymore."

    "You can feel the mood of the little girl becomes very low"

    "Luke" "You may not imagine how stupid that girl is, and she always keeps asking the silliest questions."
    "Luke" "And she often gets angry for some inexplicable reason and then yells at you."
    "UnknowMan" "Oh my god, I thought you are her friend."
    "Luke" "Friend? Are you insulting me? I'm like her babysitter."
    "Luke" "To be honest, I don't think she needs a friend, all she needs is a babysitter."
    "Luke" "Everyone can be her friend, as long as they can tell some amazing story."

    "You heard sobbing from the girl who in front of you."
    "Her shoulders trembled slightly, trying to cover her mouth with her hands without making a sound, but tears overflowed from her eyes and then ran across her cheeks and dripped to the ground."
    "The two people outside were still talking loudly, laughing loudly from time to time."
